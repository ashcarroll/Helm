# Helm

## Overview
Helm is a streamlined project and team management application built with Django. It provides an intuitive interface for managing projects, tasks, and teams with a focus on simplicity and visual clarity. Helm allows managers to create and oversee projects while team members can view assigned projects, update tasks, and collaborate effectively. The application features a modern, responsive UI built with Bootstrap and enhanced with custom styling.

#### Project Problem Statement:
Managers and Program Managers lose significant time gathering scattered information from multiple tools and places to track team and project health.

#### Project Goal:
A unified dashboard tool to consolidate this data would enable faster decision-making and more time for strategic work.

#### Target Audience:
- People Managers
- Project Managers
- Individual Contributors

## Additional Notes:

The database is also hosted on on Render.com and is being managed using pgAdmin 4 locally, when needed.

For the purposes of this project, everyone has access to all projects as if they are in one tenant or part of the same business. However, if this was a real product on the market, it would be designed as multi-tenant so each business would operate within its own isolated environment, ensuring that data remains private and secure. When a business logs in, they would only see their own projects, teams, and users - never data from other organisations.
